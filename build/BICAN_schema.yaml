          or from some ontology that extends it by classifying cell types under terms
          from the Cell Ontology

          e.g. the Provisional Cell Ontology (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl)
          or the Drosophila Anatomy Ontology (DAO) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/fbbt).


          NOTE: The closest available ontology term matching the value within the
          field ''cell_label'' (at the time of publication) MUST be used.

          For example, if the value of ''cell_label'' is ''relay interneuron'', but
          this entity does not yet exist in the ontology, users must choose the closest
          available term in the CL ontology. In this case, it''s the broader term
          ''interneuron'' i.e.  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?obo_id=CL:0000099.'
